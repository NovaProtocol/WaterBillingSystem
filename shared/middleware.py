    The invariant that makes keeping a header safe:

        A response may be ``public``-cacheable only when the path is ungated
        (the gate resolved ``action == "none"``) **and** the upstream chose
        that header itself.

    it does not demote. On a stack behind GateKeeper the gateway applies that
    demotion before the response reaches a shared cache.
