    value never survives into a development deployment; a value that already
    forbids storage is kept verbatim. In production a response that already
    carries a ``Cache-Control`` header keeps it, and only a response with none
    is given the path class's lifespan.

    The invariant that makes keeping a header safe:

        A response may be ``public``-cacheable only when the path is ungated
        (the gate resolved ``action == "none"``) **and** the upstream chose
        that header itself.

    This service is not the gate, so it cannot know whether a path was gated and
    it does not demote. On a stack behind GateKeeper the gateway applies that
    demotion before the response reaches a shared cache.
